# How to Use the Favicon Folder

Create a favicon to be used in your project. 
Doesn't need to be complicated, if you have no time a simple circle with your prominent color will do. 
Use Google Draw to create 512 x 512 px circle on a transparent background and download it as .png. 
Go to favicon.io and upload the favicon, and then download the complete zipped favicon optimized for different devices.
