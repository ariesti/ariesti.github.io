	<h1>Hi there, I'm Lovelli</h1>
	<hr>
	<h3>Let's build something <i>great</i> together!</h3>
	<p>I’m a Riau-born cultural creative who code. 
	I’m better known as Lovelli Fuad from <a href="https://theminimalweb.wordpress.com/portfolio/yellow/">Inti Binti</a>. 
	Some of my favourite tools are post-its, pens, pencils, thick lined journals, iPads, desktops, and headphones. 
	I like to have things in threes. 
	A large portion of my time is spent on acquiring digital skills, learning languages, testing things, designing, and making things.
	I work well independently and as part of a community. 
	I believe that work is a natural part of a balanced life; I take conscious measures to balance and re-balance mine.</p>
