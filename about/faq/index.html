As a freelancer, or a non-employee individual to your company, I will be receiving my income after your company files the income tax. However, PPh 21 for non-employees only applies if my total income from you reaches IDR4,500,000 (US$311) per month or IDR450,000 (US$31.1) per day for an entire month. The 2% PPh 23 withholding service income tax will automatically apply to my service fee if it is eligible for a PPh 21 filing and after the income tax is filed——only if the work does not come with a service agreement or contract."

		<p>Although I can draft you general contracts or standard agreements for a fee, I am not a practicing advocate or a consultant in the field of law. This means that I will not be providing you with advanced advice needed to cater to your very specific legal needs, and because I currently prioritize in servicing English-based projects, there might also be an added translation fee to have the documents translated to bahasa.</p>
