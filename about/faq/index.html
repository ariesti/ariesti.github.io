	<h3 class="font-weight-light text-lg-left mt-4 mb-0" itemprop="name">Blah blah blah blah <i>the</i> Jakarta Post?</h3>
	<div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
	<div itemprop="text">
	I left the Post in 2008. I haven't talked to anyone there since completing my training. I don't even know who works there anymore. I know nothing about what they're doing, and I have no opinion whatsoever to share.</p>

	<h3 class="font-weight-light text-lg-left mt-4 mb-0" itemprop="name">How good are you at math?</h3>
	<div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
	<div itemprop="text">
	Do you mean <i>adult</i> math? What you should know is I didn't get to learn college-level math or its equivalent. Now that I'm exposed to data science, coding, etc. I found that learning these things did not make me exceptionally good at math either.
	But knowing just enough math can really be beneficial for things like the rule of thirds for photography, the golden ratio for web design, and to produce better-looking curves in your designs.
