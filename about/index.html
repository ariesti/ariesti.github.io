        			Who She Is
			</h2>
			<p class="mb-8 fs-1 text-dark-1" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="250">
        			Lovelli Fuad is a full-stack freelancer based in messy Jakarta, Indonesia. 
				She works with content, data, and code to develop creative projects, such as Fingertip-Top and LVLLFD, and works on a number of other experiments.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-8 fs-1 text-dark-1" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="300">
				Since 2002, she's worked closely with nonprofits and organizations such as WHO, UNESCO, BIASA ArtSpace, and Goethe-Institut, as well as companies such as VerbalizeIt and Rev, to design content, develop interpreting services, and solve problems. 
				She's not a social media influencer, but she occassionally invests in her favorite platforms.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-8 fs-1 text-dark-1" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="350">
				She believes that work and labor are a natural part of a balanced life. Therefore, a large portion of her time is spent on calibrating herself: acquiring digital skills, learning & testing things, strategizing. 
				As a content developer, she enjoys blurring the lines of science and art, and encourages community involvement as much as possible.
