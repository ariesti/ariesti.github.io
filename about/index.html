                    Fingertip is an up and coming online zine developed for the everyday creatorâ€”those transitioning from consumer to creator. 
                    We're eager to discuss novel topics related to content creation, design, and understanding data. 
                    Our readers are in for a treat!

                <p class="pb-5 text-dark-1 fs-4 font-pop">
                    When it was founded in 2018, Fingertip started out as a static gh-pages repo. 
                    Following more recent development in static blogging, we've decided to stay a GitHub project, because we can. 
                    Things are a lot faster now than they were in the past, with ample room to host images, files, and downloads.

				    Our History
				</h3>
                <p class="pb-5 text-dark-1 fs-4 font-pop">
                    Fingertip was founded in 2018 by Lovelli Fuad, who envisioned Fingertip as an opinionated and niche resource for online zine publishing (where people express themselves through art and writing). Having a background in the humanities, she is interested in how our complex online identities and varying opinions take online forms. She started all this with a do-it-yourself attitude and a craving for creativity.
