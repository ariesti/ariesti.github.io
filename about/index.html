			<h1>Welcome to Finger Tip-Top!</h1>
			<p>
			I made this site using GitHub after learning to code. 
			<a href="https://github.com/ariesti">Coding</a> is a way to get what I want. 
			Working with codes helped me imagine new types of work unavailable to me otherwise. 
			With codes I open up new possibilities and explore what's already available, softwares, websites, applications, games, and installations. 
			I have also gained <i>artistic fluency</i> while learning to code. 
			I learned how to write applications, worked with data in my exercises, made arts, and explored more ways of expanding my consultancy works.</p>
