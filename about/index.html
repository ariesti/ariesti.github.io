    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Some of my favourite tools are post-its, pens, pencils, thick lined journals, iPads, desktops, and headphones. I like to have things in threes. A large portion of my time is spent on acquiring digital skills, learning languages, testing things, designing, and making things. I work well independently and as part of a community. I believe that work is a natural part of a balanced life; I take conscious measures to balance and re-balance mine.</p>
