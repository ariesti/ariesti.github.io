    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Lovelli. I’m a full-stack freelancer. Some of my favourite tools are post-its, pens, pencils, thick lined journals, iPads, desktops, and headphones. I like to have things in threes, and I’m good with my hands.</p>
        <p>A large portion of my time is spent on acquiring digital skills, learning languages, testing things, designing, and making things. I work well independently and as part of a community. I believe that work is a natural part of a balanced life; I take conscious measures to balance and re-balance mine.</p>
        <p>In 2013, I made the life-changing decision of participating in online learning. My goal was to digitize my life, so I started learning coding. Coding is hard; it is a way to get what I want. Working with codes helped me imagine new types of work unavailable to me otherwise.</p>
        <p>With codes I open up new possibilities and explore what’s already available, software, websites, applications, games, and installations! I have also gained artistic fluency while learning to code. And then I began branching out into the wonderful world of data and took the data science learning path. I learned how to work with data and how to write applications.</p>
        <h3>How good are you at math?</h3>
        <p>I didn’t get to learn college math, if that’s what you’re asking. My bachelor’s degree was in the humanities. It was a liberal arts education on foreign languages and literatures at a state university.</p>
        <p>But even though I didn’t study math in college doesn’t mean that I hate math. Not at all. My decision to make coding a part of my life did not affect my feelings toward math. It also did not make me exceptionally good at adult math.</p>

      <p>Hosted on <a href="https://github.com/ariesti">Github</a> with Github Pages.</p>
      <p>Built with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 3.0.</a> and then <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap 4.0</a>.</p>
      <p>Still a work in progress.</p>
      <p>This blog is written and maintained by <a href="#">Lovelli Fuad</a>. Opinions are my own.</p>
      <p>This isn’t my first online website, but this is my first attempt at getting started with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The goal of this project is to get familiar with the process of setting up and maintaining a static site with Git. It’s a simple project.</p>
      <p>In parallel to building and designing <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23fingertiptop">#fingertiptop</a>, I was also taking responsive web design courses online. I started building with Bootstrap 3.0, and later on Bootstrap 4.0.</p>
      <p>This project was built using the following languages: css, html, javascript, markdown, and a bit of processing for the mock-up and initial artwork. There’s still a bit of a to-do list for Finger Tip-Top, which you can view from the project’s repo. Please watch the project, star and <a href="https://github.com/ariesti/ariesti.github.io/tree/release-notes-redesign">fork it</a> on GitHub if you plan to build something of a static site yourself.</p>
