			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Coding is a way to get what I want. Working with codes helped me imagine new types of work unavailable to me otherwise. With codes I open up new possibilities and explore what's already available, softwares, websites, applications, games, and installations. I have also gained <i>artistic fluency</i> while learning to code. I learned how to write applications, worked with data in my exercises, made arts, and explored more ways of expanding my consultancy works.</p>
