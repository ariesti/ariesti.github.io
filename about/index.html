<h1>About</h1>
<p>
I made Finger Tip-Top using GitHub after learning to code. 
<a href="https://github.com/ariesti">Coding</a> is a way to get what I want.
I learned how to write applications, worked with data in my exercises, made arts, and explored more ways of expanding my consultancy works.
</p>
<p>
Working with codes helped me imagine new types of work unavailable to me otherwise. 
With codes I open up new possibilities and explore what's already available, softwares, websites, applications, games, and installations. 
I have also gained <i>artistic fluency</i> while learning to code.
