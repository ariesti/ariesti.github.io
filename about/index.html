		 <p>Lovelli Fuad is a full-stack freelancer based in messy Jakarta, Indonesia. She works with content, data, and code to develop creative projects, such as Fingertip-Top and LVLLFD, and works on a number of other experiments.</p>
		 <p>Since 2002, she's worked closely with nonprofits and organizations such as WHO, UNESCO, BIASA ArtSpace, and Goethe-Institut, as well as companies such as VerbalizeIt and Rev, to design content, develop interpreting services, and solve problems. She's not a social media influencer, but she occassionally invests in her favorite platforms. </p>
  		 <p class="mb-5">She believes that work and labor are a natural part of a balanced life. Therefore, a large portion of her time is spent on calibrating herself: acquiring digital skills, learning & testing things, strategizing. As a content developer, she enjoys blurring the lines of science and art, and encourages community involvement as much as possible.</p>
