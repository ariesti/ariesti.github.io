**Disclaimer: The community event ended last year in October, but my dev swag was just delivered a few business days ago.**

In case you need to know, Hacktoberfest is a chance to contribute to open source projects. 
Last year was my first time participating fully, and I did not regret any minute of it. 
Although come to think of it now, there were a few things I could have done to maximize my participation. 
If youâ€™ve been thinking about collaborating with others, open source is a great means of collaboration. 

Don't worry so much about the coding part, because the focus of Hacktoberfest is *to contribute to a software project.* 
You are not limited to only your coding skillsets. Any area where you might be able to help is within your reach: social media marketing, copywriting, editing, design, testing, bug reporting, business, etc. 

Some things you can do to get started (right away):

* **Viewport for responsive pages.** Almost all websites are built with mobile in mind nowadays, so they've got to be responsive and stay responsive. You can go over the website code and check if the viewport meta tag is correctly set up. Google's recommendation is: 

```<meta name=viewport content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">```

Copy the project's URL and paste it onto any mobile SEO tool and see if the viewport tag is correctly used. If not, there's your first PR.
