**Disclaimer: The community event ended last year in October, but my dev swag was just delivered a few business days ago.**

In case you need to know, Hacktoberfest is a chance to contribute to open source projects. 
Last year was my first time participating fully, and I did not regret any minute of it. 
Although come to think of it now, there were a few things I could have done to maximize my participation. 
If youâ€™ve been thinking about collaborating with others, open source is a great means of collaboration. 

Don't worry so much about the coding part, because the focus of Hacktoberfest is *to contribute to a software project.* 
You are not limited to only your coding skillsets. Any area where you might be able to help is within your reach: social media marketing, copywriting, editing, design, testing, bug reporting, business, etc.
