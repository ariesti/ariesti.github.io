                    Hacktoberfest motivates newbies to contribute to <b>open-source</b> projects. In case you were wondering, 2018 was my first time participating fully, and I did not regret a minute of it. Although come to think of it now, there were probably a few things I could have done to maximize my participation.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    If you’ve been thinking about collaborating with others, open source is a great start. Every year since 2013, the community celebrates open source software by rewarding contributors during the month of October.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Don’t worry so much about the coding bits, because the focus of Hacktoberfest is to <b>contribute</b> to a software project. It is first-timer friendly, and you are not limited to only your coding skill sets. Any area where you might be able to help is within your reach: social media marketing, copywriting, editing, design, testing, bug reporting, business, etc.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Okay, maybe business is still a little way off, but here are some things you can do to get started (right away):
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-4 mb-md-8" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="0">
                    1. Check for broken and/or outdated links. 
                </h4>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    This is mostly what I did. I contributed to a WebDevStudio project creating WordPress starter themes, so there were plenty of links referencing WordPress’s Codex, which has moved to a different subdomain but still at Wordpress.org. Some of these links weren't broken; they simply need to be updated to point to the most recent webpages.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-4 mb-md-8" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="0">
                    2. Fix the typos.
                </h4>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Typos are bugs! And you need to fix them. Content can be buggy, too, especially if the website is localized into other languages. Go for the obvious grammar and misspelling ones, rather than the more subtle issues of style.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-4 mb-md-8" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="0">
                    3. Make sure the viewport is for responsive pages.
                </h4>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Modern websites are built with mobile in mind, so they've got to be responsive and stay responsive. You should be able to go over the website code and check if the viewport meta tag is correctly set up.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    You should be able to copy your projects's URL and paste it on to any mobile SEO tool to check for things like the viewport tag, load time, image optimization, etc. is correctly used. If the viewport is not, for example, responsive, that could just be your very first <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>.
                </p>

                    Making Your First Ever 'Pull Request'
                </h3>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Luckily, I have read about how to make a Pull Request/PR years back when I first learned to way of Git and GitHub. So I wasn’t all that unfamiliar with the way open source projects work, but like I said, it was years ago. To make your first real PR, you need to learn to create a PR on GitHub. And you need to practice.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    There’s a bunch of very neat tutorials from Hacktoberfest’s host, Digital Ocean. I encourage you to go to their website and read their <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source" class="text-action-4" rel="nofollow">Introduction to Open Source</a> thoroughly before installing Git on your computer. Follow the Git installation guide <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-getting-started-with-git#contributing-to-open-source-projects" class="text-action-4" rel="nofollow">there</a>, too.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    But if installing Git looks like a lot of extra work, you can definitely skip it. There are open source projects, such as the freeCodeCamp repository, that will let you help improve articles by editing <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/hacktoberfest-2018-how-you-can-get-your-free-shirt-even-if-youre-new-to-coding-96080dd0b01b" class="text-action-4" rel="nofollow">directly from your browser</a>.

                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Learning about open source projects and how to contribute is only the beginning. You still need to find projects you can actually contribute to. Many are reserved for first-timers to take part in during the Hacktoberfest community event. And if you do a bit of internet search, you will find many such project lists.
                </p>

                    Just need to do some digging to find those repos.
