I don't have that many friends, which makes me the perfect person to write about friendship. In our lives, there are many types of friends. There’s the online friend, the offline friend, the Twitter friend, the Facebook friend, the blogging friend, the childhood friend, and nowadays, _the freelancer friend._ 

**If there’s not at least one freelancer friend in your life, chances are you are it.** 

Just kidding. You could also be a ghosted friend.

Can’t seem to find a freelancer friend? Try going to that cozy coffee shop around the corner and see if anybody there is sitting alone facing a laptop, while also taking pictures of the food. Try the cafes in the malls, the co-working spaces, the park benches… the beaches?! 

Better yet, try the online forums. 

## Online friendship is important

All friendships are important, ask any mum. But online friendship is a special kind of friendship. The nature of online friendship is already different from the rest. 

One of the mistakes many people make about online friendship is to make the premature assumption that online friendship is a means of developing a true offline friendship. This is so wrong in so many ways. One, it assumes that only offline friendships are real. And that, two, online friendships are probably fake.

Nope. Both online and offline friendships have a relatively equal chance of being fake. I rarely vouch for anything (or anyone), but I can attest to this: friendships are dynamic.

They are not a one-way street. They evolve and grow over time. Genuine interactions can easily turn to fake, and then genuine again, and then less fake. Especially when what both friends have in common is a lack of interest in keeping the friendship alive. 

## Online vs. offline relationship

Online and offline friendships to me don't differ that much:

* **Spending time together.** This does not happen often with my offline friends. This also does not happen often with Facebook or Twitter friends. Seriously, nobody I know uses the “watch videos together” feature on Facebook. Most of my offline friendship initiated because we were spending some time together offline (at school or social clubs) or online (at an online forum or a freelance website). But after taking home the “friend” badge, e.g. invited on Facebook or mentioned on Twitter, usually nothing much gets shared but micro posts and/or app invites.  

* **Compliments.** I usually wouldn’t know when someone is complimenting me behind my back. I don’t think there is an app for that yet. I’m not a fan of talking about others, but isn’t that what we do all the time? Nobody waits for the other person’s approval before saying that she or he has a friend that is “a great cook” or “a great wingman.”  

* **Supporting each other.** I don’t go to a friend’s music concert to provide moral support. I go to a concert to watch a musical performance. Friends can only give moral support if they care about something; it’s perfectly okay not to care openly about something. There’s always that “deep down inside” thing you have within you. 

However similar, online and offline friendships are essentially two different things. They are not one and the same. Here's an illustration. 

_Everybody talks._ But the way people talk to you when you’re out and about is different from the way you talk to someone you just met online. Due to the nature of their work, freelancers who work online might prefer one method of communication than another, e.g. email over phone.
