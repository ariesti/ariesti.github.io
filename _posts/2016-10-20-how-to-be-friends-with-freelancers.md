                    Can’t seem to find a freelancer friend? 
                    Try going to that cozy coffee shop around the corner and see if anybody there is sitting alone facing a laptop, while also taking pictures of the food. 
                    Try the cafes in the malls, the co-working spaces, the park benches... the beaches?!

				    Online friendship is important
				</h2>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    All friendships are important, ask any mum. 
                    But online friendship is a special kind of friendship. 
                    The nature of online friendship is already different from the rest
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    One of the mistakes many people make about online friendship is to make the premature assumption that online friendship is a means of developing a true offline friendship. 
                    This is so wrong in so many ways. 
                    One, it assumes that only offline friendships are real. 
                    And that, two, online friendships are probably fake.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Nope. 
                    Both online and offline friendships have a relatively equal chance of being fake. 
                    I rarely vouch for anything (or anyone), but I can attest to this: <em>friendships are dynamic.</em>
                </p>
                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    They are not a one-way street. 
                    They evolve and grow over time. 
                    Genuine interactions can easily turn to fake, and then genuine again, and then less fake. 
                    Especially when what both friends have in common is a lack of interest in keeping the friendship alive.

		    Online vs. offline relationship

                <p class="pb-8 text-dark-1 fs-2" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="50">
                    Online and offline friendships don't differ that much to me:
                </p>

		    <p><b>Spending time together.</b></p>
		    <p>This does not happen often with my offline friends. This also does not happen often with Facebook or Twitter friends. 
		    Seriously, nobody I know uses the “watch videos together” feature on Facebook. Most of my offline friendship initiated because we were spending some time together offline (at school or social clubs) or online (at an online forum or a freelance website). But after taking home the “friend” badge, e.g. invited on Facebook or mentioned on Twitter, usually nothing much gets shared but micro posts and/or app invites.</p>
