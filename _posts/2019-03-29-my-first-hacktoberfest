**Disclaimer: The community event ended last year in October, but my dev swag was just delivered a few business days ago.**

In case you need to know, Hacktoberfest is a chance to contribute to open source projects. Last year was my first time participating fully, and I did not regret any minute of it. Although come to think of it now, there could have been a few things I could do to maximize my participation. If youâ€™ve been thinking about collaborating with others, open source is a great means of collaboration.
