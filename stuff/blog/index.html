Whether you’re a painter, a woodworker or an accountant—we all have our own ways of engaging with creativity every day. That’s why we’re partnering with Bombay Sapphire, to celebrate their commitment to help everyone find their canvas. Here, we’re taking a closer look at Brazilian illustrator <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camila Rosa.</a></h2>
<p>Looking at the work of Camila Rosa, you’re confronted with a bold subtlety—neon colors and oversized figured meet curved lines and placid expressions. This all feels reminiscent of Camila herself, who is so joyful and congenial that you’d never guess she was an active member of the hardcore punk scene.</p>
<p>Here, we sit down with the oft political artist to chat about her inspirations, the tumult of her home country Brazil and how she’s working towards her goal of becoming a full-time artist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hey Camila! Before we dive in, would you mind introducing yourself with a bit about where you’re from, where you live now and your artistic style?</strong></p>
<p>Sure! I’m Camila Rosa. I’m from Joinville, a small city in the south of Brazil. I consider my artistic style like something bold, colorful and with a strong message. It’s the way I like to present myself to the world.</p>
<p><strong>When did you first get into political art? What drew you to that style?</strong></p>
<p>I started to add political views in my work around 2015. In a very subtle way, I was adding a bit of my thoughts on the world into my drawings. In 2016, this insertion became stronger due to the conservative rise we began to face in the world. But political urgency has been present in my personal life since I was 13 years old when I was introduced to the hardcore-punk music scene. The critical and political thought took me over and educated me about several topics such as feminism, veganism, LGBTQ+ rights, etc. Later, when I was 16 years old, I used to put up posters for punk gigs and political protests in my city. So in every way, it has always been part of my essence; it just took me a while to realize I could incorporate that into my work and into the language and style I was developing. But only after that process did I finally find myself as an artist.</p>
