# Fingertip-Top 

The getting started with GitHub Pages and Jekyll is a personal project of mine. The goal is to get familiar with the process of setting up and maintaining a static site with Git. It is a simple exercise to help me get started in learning this new thing. It will not serve as a portfolio site, but I plan to have my other GitHub projects linked to one of the categories that will be added later.
